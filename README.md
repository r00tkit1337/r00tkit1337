- 👋 Hi, I’m @r00tkit1337
- 👀 I’m interested in physical computer reverse engineering (interested in vulns like Ethernal Blue, as example), astrophysics lover && Ruby master.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C to create my own RunPE using Process Hollowing. I'm interested in malware analysis & development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on illegal project only, because I'm dangerous.
